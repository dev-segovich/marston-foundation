  <h1>The High Cost of Risk: <br>Why Workplace Injuries Remain One of Construction’s Biggest Challenges</h1>

  <h2 class="animate slide-left">The Human and Economic Toll of Construction Injuries</h2>
  <p class="animate slide-left">
    Construction is the engine behind much of the world’s economic progress. But for the millions of workers on job sites every day, it remains one of the most dangerous professions on the planet.
    <br><br>
    In the United States, nearly one in five workplace deaths occur in construction, even though construction workers make up only about 6% of the workforce. Every year, more than 1,000 U.S. construction workers lose their lives on the job. Non-fatal injuries are even more common—roughly one in ten construction workers is injured each year, many with life-altering consequences.
    <br><br>
    These are not just statistics. Behind every injury is a worker pulled off the job, a family facing sudden financial strain, a community impacted by loss. The economic toll of these accidents is staggering. In the U.S. alone, workplace injuries and illnesses cost the economy upwards of $170 to $250 billion annually. Employers in construction, one of the highest-risk sectors, pay workers’ compensation premiums that can be nearly triple the average across all industries. A single serious injury can cost a contractor more than $100,000 in direct claim expenses—and indirect costs like lost productivity, project delays, and workforce turnover can easily double or triple that figure.
  </p>

  <h2 class="animate slide-left">Why Prevention Is Cheaper Than Accidents</h2>
  <p class="animate slide-left">
    The math is simple but sobering: accidents cost far more than prevention. Companies that fail to prioritize safety often pay the price in higher insurance premiums, strained project timelines, and damaged reputations.
    <br><br>
    At the same time, this challenge represents an opportunity. Demand for effective safety solutions is not just about compliance—it is about economic efficiency. Smart PPE, fall detection systems, and connected safety platforms are helping companies reduce risk, avoid costly incidents, and protect their most valuable asset—their people.
    <br><br>
    In a sector where growth is inevitable, the question is no longer whether to invest in safety. It is how quickly companies will adopt the innovations that make it possible.
