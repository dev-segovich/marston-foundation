      <p class="animate slide-left">
        Across the U.S., religious organizations hold more than 100,000 parcels of land, much of it underutilized or functionally obsolete. These properties often include vast parking lots, unused education wings, or entire church buildings with dwindling congregations. In cities like Miami, St. Louis, and Kansas City, these faith-based parcels sit in strategic locations—near transit corridors, employment hubs, and housing-short neighborhoods—making them ideal candidates for redevelopment. 
        <br><br>
        In Florida, more than 38,000 acres of religious property have been identified as suitable for redevelopment. In Kansas and Missouri, we’ve seen rural and urban churches alike struggling to maintain campuses built for a different era. These sites, rather than being a liability, can be repositioned into assets that reflect the gospel’s call to service—housing the vulnerable, educating youth, or funding mission work. 
        <br><br>
        This opportunity comes at a time when affordable housing is urgently needed across the country. Municipalities are recognizing that church properties—especially those already zoned for institutional or residential use—offer a path forward. In California, the passage of AB 1851 has made it easier for churches to redevelop land without needing to replace parking. In Missouri, where more than 30% of religious land is underused, regional planning commissions are encouraging partnerships between churches and developers. 
        <br><br>
        But success depends on more than land—it requires trust, planning, and the right deal structure. With guidance, churches can secure long-term revenue through ground leases while retaining ownership of the land. They can develop affordable housing that reflects their values, create shared-use spaces with community nonprofits, or even launch new schools or job training centers. These transformations preserve the congregation’s legacy while reinvigorating its presence. 
        <br><br>
        The Marston Foundation partners with churches at every stage—from feasibility studies and zoning reviews to financial modeling and partnership negotiation. By working together, we help faith communities embrace their property’s highest calling: to serve others, sustain ministry, and create spaces of dignity and belonging.
