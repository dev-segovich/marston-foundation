      <h1>Why Small Modular Reactors Are Emerging as the Backbone of America's Energy Future</h1>

      <h2 class="animate slide-left">The United States is at a pivotal juncture in its energy landscape</h2>
      <p class="animate slide-left">
        With the retirement of aging coal plants and the increasing demand for reliable, carbon-free electricity, Small Modular Reactors (SMRs) are gaining prominence as a viable solution. SMRs, characterized by their modular design and smaller footprint compared to traditional nuclear reactors, offer enhanced safety features and flexibility in deployment. Companies like TerraPower, X-energy, and NuScale Power are leading the charge in SMR development. For instance, TerraPower's Natrium reactor project in Wyoming has received significant federal support, marking a key step toward commercial deployment.
      </p>

      <p class="animate slide-left">
        NuScale Power's SMR design achieved a milestone by becoming the first to receive certification from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in 2023. This certification clears the path for the deployment of NuScale's reactors across the country, offering a scalable and cost-effective nuclear solution. The Department of Energy (DOE) has been instrumental in promoting SMR technology, also awarding funding to X-energy for its Xe-100 reactor, further strengthening the country’s next-generation nuclear capabilities.
      </p>

      <p class="animate slide-left">
        With the global push toward decarbonization and the growing need for reliable baseload power, SMRs are poised to play a crucial role in America’s energy future. Their ability to be deployed at retiring coal plant sites, leveraging existing infrastructure and skilled workforces, makes them a strategic asset in the nation’s transition to clean energy—preserving jobs, stabilizing the grid, and supporting long-term energy independence.
