            <h2>Driving Freedom Through Parts: Investing in the Backbone of the RV Industry</h2>
            <p>
              At <b>GME Alliance</b>, we invest in the future of the <b>Recreational Vehicle (RV) and trailer parts sector</b>—the essential supply chain that powers one of America’s most iconic and emotionally resonant industries. As global RV revenues are projected to grow from <b>$56 billion in 2024 to nearly $98 billion by 2033</b>, the demand for high-quality parts that support performance, safety, and durability is accelerating. 
              <br><br>
              Our strategy centers on the foundational elements of RV production. We partner with <b>manufacturers across Asia</b> producing key RV and trailer components—including <b>axles, structural frames, electronics, and finishes</b>—and we back <b>U.S.-based innovators developing advanced safety technologies</b> that improve how RVs are operated, protected, and maintained. 
              <br><br>
              By supporting both ends of the value chain—from scalable manufacturing to high-impact safety innovation—we help shape an industry that delivers <b>confidence, comfort, and capability on the road</b>.
