              The Marston Foundation partners with faith-based organizations across the U.S. to unlock the full potential of their real estate for community benefit and long-term financial sustainability. We help churches and religious institutions transform underutilized land into mission-aligned developments, affordable housing, schools, community facilities, and cash-flowing projects, so they can better serve their congregations and neighborhoods for generations to come.

            <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#364350] mb-4">Why It Matters</h2>
            <p class="text-[#1f2933] leading-relaxed mb-4">
              Across Florida, Kansas, Missouri, and beyond, thousands of churches face declining attendance, aging buildings, and financial stress. At the same time, they sit on some of the most valuable and underused land in their communities. With the right partners, this land can become a force for good, providing housing for families in need, supporting Christian schools or Bible colleges, or generating income to fund ongoing ministry.
            </p>
            <p class="text-[#1f2933] leading-relaxed">
              In Florida alone, recent studies estimate tens of thousands of acres of religious land could be redeveloped. In Kansas and Missouri, we’ve identified dozens of congregations seeking guidance. Nationwide, a quiet movement is growing among faith communities who want to reimagine their buildings and campuses as tools for economic and spiritual revival.

            <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-[#1f2933] space-y-3">
              <li><strong>Assess and unlock property value:</strong> zoning analysis, highest-and-best-use studies, and mission-centered planning.</li>
              <li><strong>Structure the right deal:</strong> ground lease, joint venture, or fee-based development.</li>
              <li><strong>Connect churches with capital and talent:</strong> grants, tax credits, design teams, legal counsel, and construction partners.</li>
              <li><strong>Protect long-term mission outcomes:</strong> retain ownership or negotiate long-term income when selling.</li>

              Our projects range from 60-unit senior housing cottages in small towns to 600-unit mixed-income apartment buildings in major cities. Whether it's launching a new Christian school or developing affordable housing in a church parking lot, we tailor every project to meet the ministry’s unique mission and context.

              Faith-based development is not just a real estate strategy—it’s a form of modern stewardship. By helping religious institutions become wise stewards of their land, we help them generate sustainable income, stay rooted in their communities, and expand their impact.

            <p class="mt-4 text-[#1f2933] leading-relaxed">
              From rural churches in Missouri to large congregations in Miami, we’ve seen how activating sacred land can bring life back to struggling congregations while meeting urgent community needs.
