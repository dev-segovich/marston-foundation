            <h2>Building Safer Futures: Our Commitment to Construction Safety</h2>
            <p>
              GME Alliance invests in the future of construction safety—a sector where growth, innovation, and human well-being are tightly intertwined. With the global construction market projected to exceed $16 trillion by 2030 and U.S. infrastructure spending at historic highs, demand for advanced safety equipment and personal protective technologies is growing just as fast. 
              <br><br>
              Our focus is on companies that hold key patents and are developing breakthrough products—solutions designed to prevent accidents, protect workers, and enable safe, compliant project execution in a rapidly evolving construction landscape. From fall protection systems and next-gen PPE to monitoring technologies and smart safety gear, we back the innovators building a safer future for the industry. 
              <br><br>
              We believe true progress isn’t just measured by the structures we build—but by how well we protect the people who build them. Our mission is to partner with the teams creating the tools that safeguard lives and sustain the momentum of global development.

            <h2>Our Approach</h2>
            <p>
              Our investment philosophy is rooted in long-term partnership and a commitment to sectors where innovation directly meets urgent human need. In construction safety, where workplace injuries remain far too common, we seek out businesses that are raising the standard through proprietary technologies and forward-thinking solutions. 
              <br><br>
              The sector’s momentum is undeniable: 
              <br><br>

            <div style="padding-left: 25px;">
              <ul class="approach-list">
                <li>A construction market set to grow from $10.4 trillion in 2023 to over $16 trillion by 2030. </li>
                <li>A labor force where nearly 1 in 10 workers faces injury annually—with falls still the leading cause of fatalities. </li>
                <li>Stricter regulatory environments worldwide, making effective safety measures not just best practice but mandatory. </li>
                <li>Accelerating innovation in smart safety technologies, including connected PPE, fall detection systems, and real-time monitoring tools reshaping job site safety management.</li>
              </ul>
            </div>
            
            <p>
              <br>
              We invest where market growth is certain and innovation is indispensable. Construction safety is one of those rare spaces where the right technologies not only reduce risk but save lives—preventing injuries that ripple through families, companies, and communities. 
              <br><br>
              Our role goes beyond investment. We partner closely with the companies we support, providing capital, strategic direction, and access to a global network. By helping these innovators scale and succeed, we contribute to a future where progress and safety move hand in hand—where every project is built not just to stand tall, but to protect the people who make it possible.
